    <p id="info"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton">Cellular automata</a> are little programs that follow a set of rules for cells to interact with each other. It can be seen as a sort of zero-player "game". The most famous example is John
        Conway's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Game of Life</a>, where there is a square grid where if a "live" cell has two or three neighboring "live" cells, it stays alive, and if it has any other number, it "dies".
        If a "dead" cell has three neighbors, it becomes "alive" again.</p>
